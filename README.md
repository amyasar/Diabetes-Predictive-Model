# Diabetes-Predictive-Model

**Project Overview:**

Instructor: Dr. Bon K Sy

This project consists of two main parts, each addressing different aspects of diabetes patient behavior and self-efficacy.

**Part 1 - Predictive Modeling:**

In the initial phase, we focus on predicting the behavior of diabetes patients based on a smaller dataset spanning a period of six weeks. Our predictive model encompasses both Decision Tree and Linear Regression techniques. A crucial component of this phase is model evaluation, where we aim for a model accuracy exceeding 70%.

**Part 2 - Impact of Intervention:**

The second phase delves into a larger dataset to analyze the effects of intervention, specifically, the prediction activities, on a patient's self-efficacy. This stage seeks to uncover whether these interventions lead to noticeable changes in a patient's self-efficacy levels.

By dividing the project into these two distinct parts, we aim to gain valuable insights into diabetes patient behavior and the influence of interventions on their self-efficacy.
